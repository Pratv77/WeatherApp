# Weather App

Welcome to my basic Weather App! This interactive web-based weather app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to provide current weather conditions and forecast information from locations around the world. It also has a dynamic background image that reflects the place being searched. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is meant as a beginner project to practice these languages and get more comfortable with basic syntax.

## Features
- Current weather conditions and forecast information from locations around the world
- Dynamic background image that reflects the place being searched

## Usage
1. Enter a location in the search bar
2. View the current weather conditions and forecast information
